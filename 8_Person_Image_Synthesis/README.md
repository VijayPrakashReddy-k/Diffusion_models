### 1. Texture diffusion models

Texture diffusion models are a class of generative models that are used for synthesizing realistic textures from a given sample texture. These models are typically based on the idea of iteratively diffusing or spreading the texture over a space, while also preserving the statistical properties of the original texture.

The basic idea behind texture diffusion models is to start with a small patch of the input texture, and then iteratively expand it by gradually spreading the texture to nearby regions, while also smoothing out any irregularities or noise. This diffusion process is typically guided by a diffusion equation, which models the spreading of information or energy over time.

One of the main advantages of texture diffusion models is that they can generate high-quality, high-resolution textures that are visually similar to the input texture, while also being highly diverse and customizable. Additionally, these models are often faster and more computationally efficient than other generative models, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs).

There are several variations of texture diffusion models, including non-parametric diffusion models, which do not rely on a specific parametric form for the diffusion equation, and texture optimization models, which optimize a set of parameters to maximize the similarity between the synthesized texture and the input texture.

Texture diffusion models have many practical applications, including in computer graphics, game design, and virtual reality, where realistic textures are needed to create immersive environments. They are also useful for texture transfer and style transfer, where the texture of one image is transferred to another image while preserving its style and characteristics.

### 2. Classifier free guidance

Classifier-free guidance refers to the approach of providing guidance or direction to a system or individual without relying on predefined categories or labels. Instead of using a pre-trained classifier to assign labels or categories to inputs, classifier-free guidance methods typically rely on more flexible and adaptable techniques, such as reinforcement learning or unsupervised learning.

For example, in a reinforcement learning scenario, an agent can be guided towards a specific goal through trial and error, without explicit labels or categories. In an unsupervised learning scenario, patterns or structures in data can be identified without any prior knowledge of what categories or labels exist.

By removing the need for predefined categories or labels, classifier-free guidance approaches offer more flexibility and adaptability, and can be particularly useful in situations where the relevant categories or labels may not be well-defined or may change over time. However, they can also be more challenging to implement and require more sophisticated algorithms and techniques.

### 3. Distangled classifier-free guidance

Distangled classifier-free guidance refers to an approach that aims to provide guidance or direction to a system or individual without relying on predefined categories or labels, while also ensuring that the guidance is disentangled or separated into different components.

In other words, instead of providing guidance in a single, monolithic manner, distangled classifier-free guidance methods aim to provide guidance that can be broken down into different, independent components. This can make the guidance more interpretable and easier to understand, as well as more flexible and adaptable.

One example of a distangled classifier-free guidance approach is disentangled representation learning. This involves learning representations of data that are disentangled into different components, such as object identity, position, and lighting conditions. By separating these components, it becomes possible to manipulate them independently, which can be useful for tasks such as image editing or object recognition.

Another example of a distangled classifier-free guidance approach is modular reinforcement learning, which involves decomposing a reinforcement learning problem into smaller, modular components. This can make it easier to learn and optimize the different components separately, and can also make the resulting policy more interpretable and easier to understand.

Overall, distangled classifier-free guidance approaches offer a promising direction for developing more flexible, adaptable, and interpretable guidance methods, which can be particularly useful in complex and dynamic environments.


### 4. self attention vs cross attention

Self-attention and cross-attention are two types of attention mechanisms used in deep learning models, particularly in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision.

Self-attention is an attention mechanism that helps a model focus on different parts of its own input sequence or image features. In other words, it helps the model learn the relationships between different elements within the same sequence or image. Self-attention is typically used in models like transformers, where the input sequence is processed in parallel to capture long-term dependencies.

Cross-attention, on the other hand, is an attention mechanism that helps a model focus on different parts of two different input sequences or feature sets. Cross-attention is often used in tasks like machine translation, where the model needs to translate one language to another by paying attention to both the source and target language sequences.

To give a concrete example, suppose we have a language translation task where we want to translate a sentence from English to French. In this case, self-attention would help the model learn the relationships between different words within the English sentence, while cross-attention would help the model focus on the relevant parts of the French sentence while translating each word of the English sentence.

Overall, self-attention and cross-attention are both powerful mechanisms for learning the relationships between different parts of input sequences or feature sets, and are widely used in modern deep learning models for NLP and computer vision tasks.
